        <CardComponent Header="Race-Specific Crafting">
            <p>
                Each race has the ability to craft distinct items that reflect their cultural and technological
                strengths. For example, Dwarfs excel in creating powerful technological items, while Elves are skilled
                in crafting items infused with nature magic.

                    race's unique abilities to maximize efficiency and effectiveness.</li>

                    to obtain unique items and crafting recipes that your race cannot create alone.</li>
