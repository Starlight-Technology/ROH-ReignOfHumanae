        <p>
            In <strong>Reign of Humanae</strong>, magic and skills are integral to character development and gameplay.
            Here's an overview of how they work:
        </p>

        <div class="card-divider"></div>

        <CardComponent Header="Skill Development">
            <p>
                Players improve their skills through use. The more a player engages with a specific skill, the more
                proficient they become.
                For example, using a bow regularly increases the player's archery skill, unlocking new abilities and
                advantages in the skill tree.
            </p>
        </CardComponent>

        <div class="card-divider"></div>

        <CardComponent Header="Skill Trees">
            <p>
                Each skill has a dedicated tree where players can unlock and choose specific advantages or perks as they
                reach certain proficiency levels.
                This system allows for customization, enabling players to tailor their abilities to their preferred
                playstyle.
            </p>

        <CardComponent Header="Magic Channeling">
            <p>
                Players can channel magic to enhance its effects. The longer a spell is channeled, the more powerful it
                becomes, but it also consumes more mana.
                As a player’s affinity with a particular type of magic increases, both the mana consumption and
                channeling time required to reach maximum power are reduced.
            </p>
        </CardComponent>

        <div class="card-divider"></div>

        <CardComponent Header="Magic Affinity">
            <p>
                Players develop affinities for different types of magic based on their race and personal choices.
                Racial affinities may provide bonuses, such as Elves learning nature magic more quickly, while Demons
                excel in fire magic.
            </p>
        </CardComponent>

        <div class="card-divider"></div>

        <CardComponent Header="Skill Categories">
            <p>
                Skills are divided into various categories, such as combat, crafting, and magic, each offering unique
                abilities and enhancements.
                Players can choose to specialize in certain skills or develop a broad range of abilities.
            </p>
        </CardComponent>

        <div class="card-divider"></div>

        <CardComponent Header="Cross-Disciplinary Skills">
            <p>
                Some skills may benefit from others; for example, enhancing a crafting skill might improve the quality
                of magical items, or mastering agility could aid in dodging during spellcasting.
            </p>
        </CardComponent>

        <div class="card-divider"></div>

        <CardComponent Header="Skill Progression">
            <p>
                Progression is incremental, and players can see visible improvements in their abilities and the impact
                they have in gameplay scenarios.
                As players gain skill levels, they unlock new techniques, spells, and crafting recipes.
            </p>
