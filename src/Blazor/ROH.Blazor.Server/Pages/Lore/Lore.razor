    <Pages.Components.CardComponent Header="Overview of the Lore">
        <p>
            The ancient realm of Humanae flourished with a unity that transcended time. The Humanae, an intelligent race
            gifted with a collective consciousness, thrived in harmony for centuries. However, as the eons unfolded, the
            essence of Humanae splintered into distinct entities, giving rise to the Humans, Elves, Dwarfs, and Demons.

    <Pages.Components.CardComponent Header="The Age of Strife and The Age of Splendors">
        <p>
            The world of Humanae was marked by a long and brutal conflict known as the War of the Races. This era of
            strife eventually gave way to the Age of Splendors, a time of peace and prosperity forged through the
            signing of the Pact of Unity. The treaty established diplomatic relations, trade agreements, and
            collaborative efforts between the races, leading to an era of cooperation and cultural flourishing.

    <Pages.Components.CardComponent Header="The Sentinel Accord">
        <p>
            In response to the dangers posed by interdimensional portals that began appearing and unleashing
            monstrous invasions, the races formed the Sentinel Accord. This alliance saw the creation of Sentinel
            Artifacts, a blend of Dwarven technology and Elven magic, designed to protect the realms from the
            incursions. These artifacts, while effective, required constant maintenance to keep the monsters at bay.

    <Pages.Components.CardComponent Header="World Bosses">
        <p>
            The world is guarded by twelve formidable world bosses, each with unique abilities and temperaments.
            Some are peaceful and only attack when provoked, while others are inherently hostile. These bosses play
            a critical role in the world's balance and challenge players to confront their might.

    <Pages.Components.CardComponent Header="The Role of Kings">
        <p>
            Each kingdom has a ruler, initially an NPC, who governs and makes decisions such as declaring war,
            setting trade regulations, and managing guard behavior. Players can challenge and replace the reigning
            king through tournaments held every three months. If a player king fails to log in for seven days, an
            NPC king will assume the role to maintain order and peace.

    <Pages.Components.CardComponent Header="Guardians of the Realms">
        <p>
            The guards in each kingdom reflect the nature of their realms. Demonic realms employ trained hellhounds,
            Human realms use faceless summoned guards, Elven realms are protected by ents and fairies, and Dwarven
            realms have mechanical, robotic guards.

    <Pages.Components.CardComponent Header="Item Crafting">
        <p>
            Each race has unique crafting abilities and items. A master blacksmith from one race can sell crafting
            instructions to players of other races, allowing for diverse item creation across the realms. Crafting
            requires specific materials, adding depth to the crafting system.

    <Pages.Components.CardComponent Header="Magic and Skills">
        <p>
            Skills in magic, item handling, and forging improve with use. Players can channel magic to enhance its
            effects, with mana consumption and channeling time decreasing as they gain affinity with the magic type.
            This system encourages ongoing development and mastery of various skills.
