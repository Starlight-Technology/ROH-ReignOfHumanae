make sure you have installed docker

open a terminal and go to project folder that you want run
make sure that have a dockerfile on that folder
on terminal run: docker build -t NAME_OF_PROJECT .  <-- really need that dot
now you have a image of project, just run : docker run -p (port_you_want_expose):(port_you_want_expose) IMAGE_NAME NAME_OF_CONTAINER 
see print named "dockerps.jpg"
